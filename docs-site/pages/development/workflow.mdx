# Development Workflow

This guide outlines the recommended development workflow for contributing to or working with the Yamify project. Following these practices will help maintain code quality and ensure a smooth development process.

## Development Environment Setup

Before you begin, make sure you have set up your development environment as described in the [Installation Guide](/getting-started/installation).

## Branch Strategy

Yamify follows a Git branching strategy based on the GitFlow workflow, but simplified for our needs:

### Main Branches

- **main**: The production branch, containing the latest stable release
- **develop**: The main development branch, where features are integrated

### Supporting Branches

- **feature/\***: For new features (branched from and merged back to `develop`)
- **bugfix/\***: For bug fixes (branched from and merged back to `develop`)
- **hotfix/\***: For critical fixes that need to be applied to production (branched from `main`, merged to both `main` and `develop`)
- **release/\***: For preparing releases (branched from `develop`, merged to `main` and back to `develop`)

## Development Cycle

### 1. Create a New Branch

Always start by creating a new branch from the appropriate base branch:

```bash
# For a new feature
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

# For a bug fix
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop
git checkout -b bugfix/issue-description

# For a hotfix
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b hotfix/critical-issue
```

### 2. Implement Changes

Develop your feature or fix following the [Coding Guidelines](/development/guidelines). Make sure to:

- Write clean, readable, and well-documented code
- Follow the project's style and naming conventions
- Add or update tests as needed
- Keep commits small and focused on specific changes

### 3. Commit Your Changes

Follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) format for your commit messages:

```bash
# Format: <type>(<scope>): <description>

# Examples:
git commit -m "feat(auth): add Google OAuth login"
git commit -m "fix(dashboard): resolve chart rendering issue"
git commit -m "docs(readme): update installation instructions"
```

Common types include:
- `feat`: A new feature
- `fix`: A bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

### 4. Keep Your Branch Updated

Regularly update your branch with changes from the base branch to avoid conflicts later:

```bash
# While on your feature branch
git fetch origin
git rebase origin/develop

# Resolve any conflicts and continue
git add .
git rebase --continue
```

### 5. Run Tests and Linting

Before submitting your changes, make sure all tests pass and the code follows our linting rules:

```bash
# Run tests
npm test

# Run linting
npm run lint

# Fix auto-fixable linting issues
npm run lint:fix
```

### 6. Create a Pull Request

When your changes are ready for review:

1. Push your branch to the remote repository:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. Create a pull request on GitHub:
   - Set the base branch (`develop` for features/bugfixes, `main` for hotfixes)
   - Provide a clear title and description
   - Reference any related issues
   - Complete the pull request template

### 7. Code Review Process

All pull requests must be reviewed before merging:

1. At least one approving review is required
2. CI checks must pass
3. Address review feedback with additional commits or by amending existing ones
4. Once approved, the pull request can be merged

### 8. Merge Strategy

We prefer to use the "Squash and merge" option when merging pull requests to keep the main branch history clean and focused on features rather than implementation details.

## Release Process

### 1. Create a Release Branch

When ready to prepare a new release:

```bash
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop
git checkout -b release/v1.2.3
```

### 2. Version Bump

Update version numbers in relevant files:

- `package.json`
- Any other version references

### 3. Finalize Release

Merge the release branch into main and tag the release:

```bash
git checkout main
git merge release/v1.2.3
git tag -a v1.2.3 -m "Release v1.2.3"
git push origin main --tags
```

### 4. Merge Back to Develop

```bash
git checkout develop
git merge release/v1.2.3
git push origin develop
```

## Continuous Integration

Yamify uses GitHub Actions for CI/CD:

- **Build**: Verifies the project builds successfully
- **Lint**: Checks code style and formatting
- **Test**: Runs the test suite
- **Deploy Preview**: Generates a preview deployment for pull requests
- **Production Deploy**: Deploys to production when merging to `main`

## Best Practices

### Code Quality

- Write tests for new features and bug fixes
- Maintain high test coverage
- Follow the project's coding standards
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add comments for complex logic

### Pull Requests

- Keep PRs focused on a single feature or fix
- Provide context and reasoning in the description
- Include screenshots for UI changes
- Respond promptly to review feedback
- Ensure all CI checks pass

### Communication

- Discuss major changes before implementation
- Keep related discussions in GitHub issues or pull requests
- Update documentation alongside code changes
- Ask for help if you're stuck

By following this workflow, we can maintain a high-quality codebase and a smooth development process.
