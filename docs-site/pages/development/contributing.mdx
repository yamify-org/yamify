### Pull Requests

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase:

1. Fork the repository and create your branch from `main`
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation
4. Ensure the test suite passes
5. Make sure your code follows the project's coding standards
6. Issue the pull request

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- Node.js (v18.0.0 or later)
- npm (v8.0.0 or later) or yarn (v1.22.0 or later)
- Git

### Setting Up the Development Environment

1. Fork the repository on GitHub
2. Clone your fork locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/yamify.git
   cd yamify
   ```
3. Add the original repository as a remote:
   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/yamify-org/yamify.git
   ```
4. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```
5. Create a branch for your changes:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

## Development Workflow

### Running the Application

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

This will start the development server at http://localhost:3000.

### Testing

Run tests with:

```bash
npm test
# or
yarn test
```

### Linting

Check for linting issues:

```bash
npm run lint
# or

```

Fix auto-fixable issues:

```bash
npm run lint:fix
# or
yarn lint:fix
```

## Commit Guidelines

We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification for our commit messages:

- `feat:` A new feature
- `fix:` A bug fix
- `docs:` Documentation only changes
- `style:` Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code
- `refactor:` A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `perf:` A code change that improves performance
- `test:` Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- `chore:` Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools

Example:
```
feat(auth): add login with Google feature
```

## Pull Request Process

1. Update the README.md or documentation with details of changes if appropriate
2. Update the CHANGELOG.md if applicable
3. The PR must pass all CI checks
4. The PR requires approval from at least one maintainer
5. For major changes, the PR may require multiple approvals

## Style Guides

### TypeScript Style Guide

We follow the [Google TypeScript Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/tsguide.html) with some modifications. Additional rules are enforced through our ESLint configuration.

### Documentation Style Guide

- Use Markdown for documentation
- Use sentence case for titles and headings
