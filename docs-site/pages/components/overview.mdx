# Components Overview

Yamify uses a component-based architecture to promote reusability, maintainability, and consistency throughout the application. This section documents the various components available in the Yamify application.

## Component Categories

Yamify components are organized into the following categories:

### UI Components

Basic building blocks of the user interface that can be used across the application. These include buttons, cards, alerts, badges, etc.

[View UI Components →](/components/ui-components)

### Layout Components

Components responsible for structuring the application layout, such as containers, grids, panels, and navigation elements.

### Form Components

Components used for collecting user input, including text fields, checkboxes, radio buttons, selectors, and complete form implementations.

## Component Design Principles

Our components follow these key design principles:

1. **Composability**: Components should be easily combined to create more complex UI structures
2. **Reusability**: Components should be designed for reuse across different parts of the application
3. **Accessibility**: All components must meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards
4. **Responsiveness**: Components should adapt appropriately to different screen sizes
5. **Performance**: Components should be optimized for performance and minimal re-renders

## Using Components

To use a component in your application, simply import it from its respective location:

```tsx
// Importing a UI component
import { Button } from '@/components/ui/Button';

// Using the component
function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <Button variant="primary" onClick={() => console.log('Clicked')}>
      Click Me
    </Button>
  );
}
```

## Component Documentation Structure

Each component's documentation includes:

- **Overview**: A brief description of the component and its purpose
- **Props**: Detailed information about the component's props and their types
- **Examples**: Code examples showing different ways to use the component
- **Variants**: If applicable, showcases of different component variants
- **Accessibility**: Specific accessibility considerations for the component

## Customizing Components

Yamify components can be customized in several ways:

1. **Props**: Most components accept various props to modify their appearance or behavior
2. **Composition**: Components can be composed together to create custom UI elements
3. **Extending**: For advanced cases, components can be extended to add additional functionality

## Adding New Components

If you're contributing to Yamify and need to add a new component, please follow these guidelines:

1. Place the component in the appropriate directory based on its type
2. Ensure the component is properly typed with TypeScript
3. Write unit tests for the component
4. Document the component following our documentation standards
5. Add the component to this documentation
